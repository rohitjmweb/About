	   <p>Say life has a certain number of components that make a whole:
      <br><br>
      Health. Money. Assets. Love. Sex. Adventure. Erudition. Interestingness. Social Life. Travel. Family. Experiences. 
      </p>
      
        <br>
      
       <p>On a course of a normal life, all these components regress to the mean. Assuming an equal weight<a href="#footnote1" font-size="10px"><sup>[1]<sup></a>
      for each of those, your life is a simple average of these components.
      For instance, a purely mediocre person will be mediocrely funny, mediocrely wealthy, have a mediocre marriage, et cetera. 
     

      Most people live life seeking mediocrity in each of these components. You ought to reject that. You see, if you seek to maximize a few of those 
      components that align to your strengths early on in life, the rest, sooner or later, will take care of themselves.
      </p>
      
        <br><br>

      <p>It's much better to be stuck in life with say, excellent health, a great love life, wide and tasteful erudition, and a craft(s) you are 
        top percentile competent in while having an income<a href="#footnote2" font-size="10px"><sup>[2]<sup></a> below the peer average of your social class as 
        opposed to being average(probably below) in all these aspects.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>There are obvious risks in this. There is a chance not all the chips fall into place. Many great people in history lived a life that was terrible 
        in most aspects but just sublime in a few(or one), often with no benefit to themselves but creating tremendous value for the world. <br>
         Tesla. Dostoyevski. Nietzsche. <br>

      You should never fall into the romantic delusion that suffering leads to great work and go seek misery for it's sake. But it sometimes happens. 
      Anyway, no one is immune to bad luck. C'est la vie.
      </p>

      <p class="para_heading">Footnotes:</p>

      <br>

      <p id="footnote1" >[1] I assumed a equal weight. Real life is complex. There are obvious biggies, like love which is precarious and difficult to judge, 
        and health, which is only attainable by day to day effort. On the other hand is money, which is a biggie, but can happen through multiple sources, 
	often serendipitously.<br>
        (I don't think trying to find love from multiple sources ends well. Haha.)
      </p>
	      <br>

      <p id="footnote2">[2] Money is also interesting in that, it is subject to the law of diminishing returns. Love(if you do it right) or health isn't. 
      On the contrary.<br>
      Smarter to act on those first. <br>
      Also, if you are truly are those other things, especially the top percentile competent in one or more crafts, it's highly unlikely you will stay 
      below average in income for too long.
